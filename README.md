Create-react-app is used in this project

Steps to run the project:
* `yarn`
* `yarn start-server` - a proxy server to mitigate the problems I was having with cors 
* `yarn start`
* That's about it

The tests were written with jest and react-testing-library. To run them `yarn test` should be enough I guess.
